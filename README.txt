This Master Branch is the Current build of the program

The project is by Drew Butler & Corey McCarty
	Essentially abandoned 
	The purpose was a 'No Look' app launcher
	This would decrease distraction while driving
	there is an assumption that some people will continue to use smartphones while driving even when it is against the law and this project seeks to reduce the amount of attention that simple tasks require
	

	NOTE: TEXTING AND MANIPULATING PHONE WHILE DRIVING IS ILLEGAL
	The developers accept no responibility in the case of a user accident or ticketing
	


Created for Class in Fall 2013
	The assignment required execution as a service
	and the trigger mechanism had to be sensor based
	i.e. not using the screen
	This program is intended for NOVELTY ONLY
	and the grade in our class of course

Pupose 


This project is more or less abandoned
It was discovered that 'Tasker' achieve all executions herein
The profiles and tasks needed in Tasker to achieve these 
functions take less than 15 minutes to setup
